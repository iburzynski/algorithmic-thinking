    set of counties is empty and whose total population is zero. The cluster 
    centers Î¼f, computed by lines 2 and 8-9, should stay fixed as lines 5-7 are 
    executed during one iteration of the outer loop. To avoid modifying these 
    values during execution of lines 5-7, you should consider storing these 
    cluster centers in a separate data structure. Line 7 should be implemented 
    using the merge_clusters method from the Cluster class. merge_clusters will 
    automatically update the cluster centers to their correct locations based on 
    the relative populations of the merged clusters.
